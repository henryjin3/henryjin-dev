Last week I finished up Andrew Ng's famous introductory class on [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). As I mentioned in my [last post](https://henryjin.dev/writing/my-first-steps-toward-machine-learning), I thought I would move on to Google's [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course), which I did this week. To my surprise, I already knew most of the material contained in that course, and so I quickly moved through it.

Having finished that, I still felt the need for more practical experience, and so I went to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/henryjin3) to see what I could get done. To get my feet wet, I decided to start with the introductory competition, which is [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This is a fairly basic case, where you are provided a passenger list and data and asked to train a model which predicts the passengers who will ultimately perish.

To my surprise, I opened up an editor, and found myself completely at a loss. I simply had no idea how to start from scratch. I eventually found a tutorial and followed it, but I found that although I understood each of the steps that was being taken, I had no concept of how to come up with them myself. Then I came across [this guide](https://www.kaggle.com/pliptor/how-am-i-doing-with-my-score), which just blew me away. There was simply no way I could have come up with half of those possible solutions, let alone the optimal one.

As such, I realized I need to temper my expectations a bit. I still plan on continuing my learning, albeit with a significantly higher emphasis on practical implementation so that I can retain the theory that I have already learned. As such, I will be looking to implement a few classics of Machine Learning on this very website! If I'm lucky, I'll have one up by the end of this week. I'm also starting to look at [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) so I can leverage what I have learned into my existing .NET background.

Learning any of the above too? Message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-jin/), I'd love to connect and share stories!
